# Human-Image-Segmentation:

# Goal
In this project, we will feed images and their mask to a model that will produce a segmented mask of humans for our given images. 
We can use these segmented results for artificially blur the background of the images, in self-driving cars, change the background
of the images, image editing, detecting humans in the image, and lots of possibilities.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 300 images of humans with some background and a corresponding binary mask for each of these images.
